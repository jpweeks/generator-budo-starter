* [Budō](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) / [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)

* General purpose utilities (with no home elsewhere yet)

## Warning

This is a personal work in progress comprised of configs and utils from my personal projects. There is not much here in terms of architecture; it has been intentionally left open-ended as a starting point for experimentation, while still providing useful tooling I have come to enjoy as part of my workflow.

If you've somehow stumbled here and are thinking about using this, you probably shouldn't.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-budo-starter using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-budo-starter
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo budo-starter
```

## Getting To Know Yeoman

 * Yeoman has a heart of gold.
 * Yeoman is a person with feelings and opinions, but is very easy to work with.
 * Yeoman can be too opinionated at times but is easily convinced not to be.
 * Feel free to [learn more about Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
